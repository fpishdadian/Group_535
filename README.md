This is an experimental user interface for searching Congress members created for EECS 330: Human Computer Interaction class at Northwestern University.

### Installation

Then point the browser to http://localhost:8000/index.html

WW: I am testing my git pull/push, I opened the browser, that looks pretty cool. Then we can fill in the information for the members.
